## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability or have any security concerns related to UMEAS, please email the maintainers at wjb102@miami.edu. Provide as much information as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue. We will review the report and address the issue promptly.


## Security Best Practices

- Keep your Flutter SDK and all dependencies up to date.
- Use strong cryptographic algorithms and follow the latest encryption standards.
- Avoid storing sensitive information, like API keys or tokens, in the source code.
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks.
- Implement secure data storage practices, like encrypting sensitive data.


## Security-related Configuration

- Enable secure network connections by enforcing HTTPS.
- Implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms.
- Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent unauthorized loading of resources.
- Implement proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies to restrict access to resources.
